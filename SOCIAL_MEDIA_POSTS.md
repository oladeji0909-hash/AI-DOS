🚀 I built a complete ML platform. Here's a 2-minute demo.

AI-DOS is an open-source ML platform with 9 microservices that lets you build, deploy, and scale models in under 30 seconds.

🎯 What you'll see in this demo:
• Natural language to production ML (Magic Mode)
• Real-time monitoring of all 9 services
• Business intelligence & analytics (44% ROI tracking)
• Auto-scaling with up to 100% cost savings
• Team collaboration & sharing
• Model marketplace (buy/sell models)
• Complete CLI & Python SDK

💡 The Problem:
Building production ML infrastructure is complex. You need experiment tracking, deployment pipelines, monitoring, scaling, collaboration tools, and more. Most teams spend months setting this up.

✨ The Solution:
AI-DOS gives you everything in one command:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

🏗️ Architecture:
• API Gateway - Authentication & routing
• DataForge - Dataset management
• ModelHub - Experiment tracking
• Magic Mode - Natural language ML
• Marketplace - Buy/sell models
• Deploy - Production deployment
• Collaboration - Team workflows
• AutoScale - Smart scaling
• Analytics - Business intelligence

📊 Real Results (from the demo):
• 77 models tracked
• 359 experiments
• $12,154 revenue
• 44% ROI
• 100% cost savings with auto-scaling

🔧 Tech Stack:
Python, FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO

🌟 It's Open Source:
