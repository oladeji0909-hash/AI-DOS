## 🚀 WEEK 2-4: BUILD MAGIC MODE

The feature that makes developers say "HOLY SHIT!"

### What is Magic Mode?
```python
from aidos import magic

# User types this:
magic.create("Build a sentiment analyzer for tweets")

# AI-DOS does this automatically:
# 1. Creates dataset (scrapes/generates data)
# 2. Preprocesses data
# 3. Selects best model architecture
# 4. Trains model
# 5. Evaluates performance
# 6. Deploys to production
# 7. Returns API endpoint

# All in 30 seconds. Zero code. Production-ready.
```

### Implementation Plan:

**Week 2: Core Magic Engine**
- [ ] Natural language parser (understand user intent)
- [ ] Task classifier (sentiment, classification, generation, etc.)
- [ ] Template library (pre-built pipelines)
- [ ] Code generator (creates Python code)

**Week 3: Integration**
- [ ] Connect to DataForge (dataset creation)
- [ ] Connect to ModelHub (training)
- [ ] Connect to DeployEngine (deployment)
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline

**Week 4: Polish & Demo**
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Progress tracking
