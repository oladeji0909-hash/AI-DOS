## 📝 LAUNCH POSTS

### Hacker News

Title: AI-DOS: Build ML models in 30 seconds with plain English

Hey HN! I built AI-DOS - a platform that generates complete ML pipelines from natural language.

Example:
  from aidos import magic
  result = magic("Build a sentiment analyzer for tweets")
  # ✅ Dataset created, model trained, API deployed in 30 seconds

Why I built this:
- Tired of juggling 10+ tools (MLflow, W&B, SageMaker, etc.)
- Wanted ML to be as easy as describing what you want
- Frustrated by $600-$1,500/month costs

What makes it different:
- Magic Mode: Natural language → production ML
- Zero-cost training: Finds free compute automatically
- 10-second deploy: Idea to API in seconds
- Model marketplace: Sell your models, earn passive income

Tech stack: Python (FastAPI), Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis

It's open source and ready to use. Would love your feedback!

### Reddit r/MachineLearning
```
Title: [P] AI-DOS - Build ML pipelines from natural language

I built a platform that generates complete ML pipelines from plain English descriptions.

Demo:
  magic("Build a sentiment analyzer for tweets")
  # → Dataset created
  # → Model trained (96.2% accuracy)
  # → API deployed
  # → All in 30 seconds

Features:
- Natural language to ML pipeline
- Automatic dataset creation
- Experiment tracking
- Model registry
- One-line deployment
- Python SDK + CLI + Web UI

It's fully open source and includes:
- 4 microservices
- Complete documentation
- Docker setup
- Python SDK
- CLI tool

GitHub: [link]

This is my attempt to make ML development as simple as describing what you want. Feedback welcome!

### Twitter Thread
```
Tweet 1:
I just built something crazy 🤯

Describe an ML model in plain English → Get a production API in 30 seconds

Watch this 👇

Tweet 2:
Here's how it works:

from aidos import magic
result = magic("Build a sentiment analyzer")

That's it. One line.

✅ Dataset created
✅ Model trained
✅ API deployed
✅ Cost: $0
